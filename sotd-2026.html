  <h1>Songs of the Day 2026</h1>
  <p>
    This is a list of, "Songs of the Day", which are either new to me, a rediscovered favorite, or just something that struck me in the moment.
    Many of these will be songs I heard while tuning into <a href="https://wfmu.org/">WFMU</a>.
    I'll usually include a link where you can listen, and purchase, tracks you like too.
