      <em><strong>Sugarlift</strong></em> is the process of painting some kind of sugar solution onto an etching plate.
      A hard ground is applied to the plate.
      The plate is then submerged into hot water, allowing the sugar to dissolve and break up through the hard ground, leaving a stencil like effect.
      The plate can then be dusted with rosin, and etched.

      I've used both of these recipes for <em>Lift Ground</em> or <em>Sugarlift</em>.
      They both work quite well.
      The biggest difference is the usage of either grated soap or liquid dish washing detergent.

    <p>
      According to Rhea Fontaine at <a href="http://www.paulsonbottpress.com/">Paulson Press</a>
      this is the formula used in making their prints with Margaret Kilgallen.

      <li>
        Clean and degrease your plate thoroughly.
        Any contamination or grease (even fingerprints) can interfere with the lift.
      </li>
      <li>
        Paint (I use a watercolor brush) the sugarlift on.
        Remember that it will lift evenly.
        If you want different values of contrast, perform multiple lifts, or stage bite the resulting <a href="/teaching/aquatint.html">aquatint</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Allow the sugarlift to dry.</li>
      <li>
        Coat the entire plate with a thin coating of liquid hard ground.
        I've had good results with <a href="https://www.graphicchemical.com">Graphic Chemical's</a> Universal Etching Ground Part Number 12390.
        Avoid any type of hard ground that needs to be cooked as heat may cause the ground to prematurely begin lifting.
      </li>
      <li>Allow the ground to set.</li>
      <li>
        Boil some water.
        An electric tea kettle can be found in most print shops.
      </li>
      <li>Place the plate into a photo, or similar, tray.</li>
      <li>Pour the hot water onto the plate to begin the lift process.</li>
      <li>
        The ground will begin to lift.
        On larger plates you may need to heat and pour water more then once.
      </li>
      <li>Once the lift process is complete, dry the plate</li>
      <li>
        Optionally open bite the plate for a bit, dropping the exposed surface of the plate.
        This protects the aquatint and provides for more quality prints when editioning
      </li>
      <li>Apply rosin for an aquatint.  Stop out and etch as desired.</li>
    </ol>
