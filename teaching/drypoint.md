# Drypoint

## Prep

Bevel the plate
Transfer any drawing

## Draw

Check progress by wiping up with some ink.  Do not proof until ready.

Corrections are easier to fix, as you only need to remove the burr and a shallow scratched line.

The angle of the tool will produce a different tone.
Straight up and down produces an even burr on either side of the line.
Held to one side or another the burr will be heavier on the opposite side.

## INK

Add a touch more oil to the ink.
Use a soft card to spread the ink.


## Print

Use less pressure then with an etching.
Too much pressure will cause the drypoint to wear much faster.

Otherwise printing is same as with an etching.
