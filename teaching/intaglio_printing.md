# PRINTING THE INTAGLIO PLATE:

## Prep
1.  Measure and tear paper down to size.  It can be helpful to initial the back and indicate the type of paper for future reference.
2.  Place paper in soaking tray.  (~20-30 min for BFK)
3.  Make sure printing press pressure and the blankets are set up correctly.
4.  Lay out and modify ink if necessary.

## Ink
5.  Card ink onto plate.
6.  Use dirty tarletan and daub the ink evenly over the plate.
7.  Start wiping the plate with tarletan in a circular motion.  Alternate clockwise and counterclockwise, starting with heavier pressure and lighting as plate is cleaned.  Try to wipe the entire plate in every pass.  Pay attention to the corners.
8.  Clean the edges of the plate with a rag or paper.  give a final wipe with a new tarletan or your palm.

## Print
9.  Place registration template on to the press.
10.  Place plate on the registration template.
11.  With clean hands remove paper from soaking tray and blot dry.
12.  Place paper onto print and registration template.  Remember it is easier to handle from opposite corners.
13.  Place a sheet of newsprint on top.
14.  Gently fold down blankets.
15.  Run the plate through the press with a even and steady pressure.

## Finish
16.  Remember to clean off any ink on the registration template or press bed before the next person prints.
17.  Dry prints between blotters or newsprint and under some weight to prevent curling.
18.  Allow at least a day for ink to dry if printing a second drop.
