  Jeez, I'm bad at blogging.
  Meant to try and post something weekly, and it's been a month.
</p>

<p>
  I've been drawing a lot of comics.
  Some colabs with Max and more Candy Thief.
  It's fun.

<p>
  I just payed my table fee's for this years <a href="https://shortrun.org">Short Run Comix Festival</a>.
  It's November 2nd in Seattle, WA at the Fisher Pavilion.
  I'm excited to go again, it's by far my favorite zine/comix show to table at.
  Now to get to work!

<h2>Listening</h2>
<p>
  The new Onidea album is good! Especially the <a href="https://oneida.bandcamp.com/track/reason-to-hide">first track</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Mandy's <a href="https://mwinters.bandcamp.com/track/forsythia-2">Forysthia</a> is a jammer too.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/miami-review-of-109217116">Miami Review of Comics</a> a new podcast from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/drewlerman/">Drew Lerman</a>.
  First episode was a nice conversation between Alex Graham (Dog Biscuits) and Ceder Van Tassel (Apple and Beefwood) about some of the nuances of online comics posting.
  I'm a big fan of Snake Creek and look forward to episode 2.

    This issue of Bubbles is mostly interview transcriptions and photos from Bubbles Fest.
    I'd like every show to do this.
    There is something nice about being able to catch up on talks you missed when tabling, other then scrubbing through youtube.

    Also reread through my stack of Ganges comics
    I think Kevin's one of the best to be working now, and a bit under sung.
    The newest issue of Felder has been nominated for an Ignatz this year.
