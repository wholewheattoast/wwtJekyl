  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Content, as opposed to subject matter, may be described as&#8230; that
      which a work betrays but does not parade.
      It is the basic attitude of a nation, a period, a class, a religious
      persuasion - all this unconsciously qualified by one personality,
      and condensed into one work.
      It is obvious that such an involuntary revelation will be obscured in
      proportion as one of two elements, IDEA or FORM, is voluntarily
      emphasized or suppressed.
    </p>

    <p>
      A spinning machine is perhaps the most impressive manifestation of a
      functional idea and an abstract painting is probably the most expressive
      manifestation of pure form, but both have a minimum of content.
