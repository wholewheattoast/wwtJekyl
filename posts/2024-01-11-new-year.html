  Hey, It's been a while since I've updated this site.
  During the end of the year I decided it was time to dust off the cobwebs.
  I've migrated to a new static site generator (from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a><sup>*</sup> to <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>), upgraded the web server, and fixed all those bugs that show up when you aren't looking.
</p>

<p>
    It seems like the "personal web" (or some say '<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/internet-future-about-to-get-weird-1234938403/">Weird Web</a>') is making a come back.
    Last few years I've mostly been posting stuff to Instagram, but that's starting to give off dying mega-mall vibes.
    So, my new years resolution is to post here more often.
</p>

<h2>New Zines</h2>

<div class="item-grid">
    <div class="item-panel">
        <img src="/image/publications/fax-simile-16/fax-simile-16-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="Cover of Fax Simile 16" />
    </div>
    <div class="item-panel">
        <img src="/image/publications/isometric-tuna-8/isometric-tuna-08-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="Cover of Isometric Tuna 8" />
    </div>
    <div class="item-panel">
        <img src="/image/publications/object-on-arrival-2/object-on-arrival-02-cover-thumb.jpg" alt="Cover of Object on Arrival 2" />
    </div>
</div>

    In November I tabled at <a href="http://shortrun.org/">Short Run</a>, and made some new zines.
    They're posted on the <a href="/publications.html">publications</a> page, and they are available to purchase at <a href="wholewheattoast.bigcartel.com">Bigcartel</a> if you'd like one.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="/publications/fax-simile-16.html">Fax Simile no. 16</a>, the most recent issue of my collection of weirdo gag comics.
    <a href="/publications/isometric-tuna-8.html">Isometric Tuna no. 8</a>, diary comics from my pocket notebooks.
    And <a href="/publications/object-on-arrival-2.html">Object on Arrival no. 2</a>, drawings and comics from 2022 and 2023.
</p>

<p>
    * Jekyll was and is still a great tool, but I don't use Ruby much, and got tired of version management for it.
