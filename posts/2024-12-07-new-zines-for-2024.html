    Short Run was at the beginning of November, and I had printed 4 new zines.
    I just got around to putting them up on the site.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/comics/candy-thief/candy-thief-01.html">Candy Thief</a> number one!
        Color printing is expensive so let's redraw it in black and white.
        Maybe I'll draw more?
        I think it came out nice.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/publications/fax-simile-17.html">Fax Simile 17</a>, more thick line weirdo gag comics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/publications/isometric-tuna-9.html">Isometric Tuna 9</a>, little drawings from my pocket notebooks from 2024.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="/publications/object-on-arrival-3.html">Object on Arrival</a>, bigger drawings from bigger sketchbooks from this year.
    </li>
</ul>

    Is it odd to separate the drawings by size or thickness of line? Who knows.
    It feels like I've run a lot of these ideas to ground.
    Maybe time to till some new fields?
    Winter is good for that.

    A month ago I decided I needed a break from instagram.
    I was spending too much time on that app, doesn't feel healthy.
</p>
<p>
    First few days felt like quitting smoking, twitchy fingers constantly wanting to open up the app and scroll.
    The FOMO's strong. It feels like insta is the only place that comics and art folks are posting stuff.
    I mean there's patreon, but that has it's own issues.
    While I miss seeing what everyone is doing, I don't miss generating content and clicks for zuck.
    Who needs it?
</p>
<p>
    Originally was just going to take a break, but now it feels more or less permanent.
    We'll see.
