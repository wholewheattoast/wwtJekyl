    Have you heard about "Week Notes"?
    I like the idea, little regular posts summing up the various things you've been up to.
    I had meant to start at the beginning of the year, but well.
    Going to give it a try.
    I'd like to post stuff here and not just on the socials, and weekly feels like a cadence I can handle.

    I've put up a page collecting some comics I've been drawing this year.
    Quick, fun, no planning, pen on letter sized paper with color pencil.
    They're about a crocodile (or is it an alligator) who steals candy from children.
    <a href="/comics/candy-thief.html">Go take a look</a>.
    I need to clean up the scans, but if I waited around to do it proper, I'd never get them up.

    Shelly Duval passed away this week and I've been listening to her tracks from the Robert Altman "Popeye" movie.
    <a href="https://www.wfmu.org/flashplayer.php?version=3&show=141926&archive=255602&starttime=1:22:24">This demo</a> is a good listen.
    I hadn't heard it before.

    Last weekend I read a ton of great comics, and got the new Peep Show in the mail today.
    Maybe I'll write something about them next week.
    Here's a list.
