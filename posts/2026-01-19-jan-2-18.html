    Keeping a list of <a href="/sotd-2026.html">songs of the day</a>. Did this off an on <a href="/sotd-2025.html">last year</a>. Got discouraged any time I missed a day, and eventually gave it up.  Trying again, not going to sweat it if I miss a day. I'm interested enough in how it changes the way I listen to music to get over my perfectionism.

    Re-reading some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Franck" target="_blank">Frederick Franck</a>, two quotes I jotted down.
    <q>The meaning of life is to see.</q>
    <cite>Hui Neng</cite>,
    and <q>The mystical of the world is that it exists.</q>
    <cite>Ludwig Witgenstein</cite>.

    Saw a pod of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_porpoise" target="_blank">Harbor Porpoises</a> in the channel on Thursday.
    At first wasn't even sure what I was looking at.
    The dorsal fin was noticeable and unusual.
    I had seen a seal a few minute before, was it that rolling on it's side as it dived?
    We're there sharks here? I didn't think so.
    After a few minutes it was apparent that there was a whole pod of porpoises, not just one.

<p>A bit of sun over this long weekend.</p>

  Sunday a good bumper sticker on the car in front, "We'd rather be a province."
  Heavy frost today.
