  Last week I decided to print a new issue of Fax Simile for the first time since 2019.
  Since before COVID.
</p>
<p>
    Fax Simile is a zine series I've published regularly since around 2013.
    I tend to put in a particular type of drawing, what I think of as weirdo gag cartoons, and during the pandemic I just wasn't drawing much in that style.
    Suddenly I'm interested again.
    It seemed the best thing to do was to look over what I had from this hiatus and put out another issue.
</p>

<p>
    So <a href="/publications/fax-simile-15.html">Here's issue 15</a>.
</p>
 
<p>
    Another thing I did during COVID was draw a lot of self portraits.
    Many in the reflection of a shiny coffee pot, or during video chats.
    This one is in a small hand mirror at the kitchen table.
    Reading a book on Bonnard it mentioned Italian painters in the past calling the practice of incorporating a mirror into the composition as <em>a specchio</em>?
