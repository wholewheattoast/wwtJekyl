    Hey it's a new year...
</p>

<p>
    Took some time off at the end of December.
    Did as close to nothing as it's possible to do.

    I had this notebook i got from <a href="https://www.silvanie.com/">Silvanie</a> a couple of years ago, with great drawing paper in it.
    Unfortunately the binding was so tight it wasn't very good as a sketchbook.
    So I took it apart and rebound it.
    Making little pen and ink drawings with my morning coffee.
    Been using a Hunt 102 again.
    It's nice.

    Last year I started keeping a list of songs I heard throughout the day that really struck me.
    Songs I hadn't heard before or at least not in awhile.
    I thought I'd try to keep that up this year, so putting them up on a page <a href="/sotd-2025.html">here</a>.

    After the news today of facebook's bullshit, I've downloaded my insta archive and marked my account for deletion.  Good riddance.  It feels odd loosing a whole chunk of your life, just like that.  Leaving twitter when Elon bought it felt similar.  You're used to having this constant feed of information, whatever connections made with folks, your little garden of posts.  Then it's gone. Poof.
