				<em><strong>Sugarlift</strong></em> is the process of painting some kind of sugar solution onto an etching plate.  A hard ground is applied to the plate.  The plate is then submerged into hot water, allowing the sugar to dissolve and break up through the hard ground, leaving a stencil like effect.  The plate can then be dusted with rosin, and etched.

				I've used both of these recipes for <em>Lift Ground</em> or <em>Sugarlift</em>. They both work quite well. The biggest difference is the usage of either grated soap or liquid dish washing detergent.

				<h3>Paulson Press Formula</h2>

					According to Rhea Fontaine at <a href="http://www.paulsonbottpress.com/">Paulson Press</a> this is the formula used in making their prints with <a href="http://www.paulsonbottpress.com/artists/kilgallen_margaret/kilgallen.html">Margaret Kilgallen</a>.

				<ol>
					<li>Clean and degrease your plate thoroughly.  Any contamination or grease (even fingerprints) can interfere with the lift.</li>
					<li>Paint (I use a decent watercolor brush) the sugarlift on.  Remember that it will lift evenly.  If you want different values of contrast, perform multiple lifts, or stage bite the resulting aquatint.</li>
					<li>Allow the sugarlift to dry.</li>
					<li>Coat the entire plate with a thin coating of liquid hard ground. I've had good results with <a href="https://www.graphicchemical.com">Graphic Chemical's</a> Universal Etching Ground Part Number 12390.  Avoid any type of hard ground that needs to be cooked on, as the heat may cause the ground to prematurely begin lifting.</li>
					<li>Allow the ground to set.</li>
					<li>Boil some water.  An electric tea kettle or coffee maker can be found in most print shops.</li>
					<li>Place the plate into a photo, or similar, tray.</li>
					<li>Pour the hot water onto the plate to begin the lift process.</li>
					<li>The ground will begin to lift.  On larger plates you may need to heat and pour water more then once.</li>
					<li>Once the lift process is complete, dry the plate</li>
					<li>I tend to open bite the plate for a short period of time in order to drop the aquatint just below the surface of the plate.  This helps protect the aquatint during transit and provides for more quality prints when editioning</li>
					<li>Apply rosing for an aquatint.</li>
					<li>Stop out and / or etch as desired.</li>
