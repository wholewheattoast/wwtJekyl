                <em><strong>Aquatint</strong></em> allows for tonality to be achieved with the etching process.  Tiny droplets of an acid resistant material, typically rosin or spraypaint, are applied to a plate.  The plate is submerged in acid which bites around the unprotected portions creating small pits, similar to stippling.  This can achieve a wide range tonal qualitys when printed.  The longer the etching time, the darker the achieved tone.

                    <li>Thoroughly clean and degrease the plate.</li>

                    <li>Check that the hotplate next to the <em>rosin box</em> is turned on and set to ~350</li>

                    <li>Crank the <em>rosin box</em> fan for a couple of minutes.</li>

                    <li>Wait a minute to allow the larger particles to settle out of the air.  If too large this particles, when melted, will effectively act as a dot of stop out.</li>

                    <li>Place your plate on to a support at least a few inches larger then the plate itself.  This helps keep internal air currents from disturbing rosin around the edges of the plate.</li>

                    <li>Quickly open the <em>rosin box</em> and place the plate and support onto the rack, centering it inside as possible.</li>

                    <li>The longer the plate is inside the <em>rosin box</em>, the more rosin will settle on the plate.  I would recommend ~5 to 10 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Remove the plate and without disturbing the dusting place it on the hot plate.</li>

                    <li>Watch for the color change, from light yellow to almost clear,  indicating the rosin has melted and bonded to the plate.  Remove the plate promptly when this change occurs.  If you overcook the rosin, it will spread out effectively shellacking the entire surface of the plate.</li>

                    <li>Allow the plate to cool before applying any ground or placing in the etching bath.</li>

                    <li>Cover any areas that will remain "white" before etching.</li>

                    <li>Once you have etched the plate, continue to stop out areas and stage additional bites.</li>

                    <li>When etching is completed, wash off the rosin using denatured alcohol, then clean any remaining stop-out or ground before proofing.</li>
