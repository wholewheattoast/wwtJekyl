# ETCHING:

## PLATE PREPARATION:

1. Bevel plate (45 degree angle).
2. Polish/clean plate.

## Ground:  (Ball Ground)

1. Set the hot plate to around 200 degrees.
2. Lay a sheet of aluminum foil down to keep hot plate clean.
3. Set your plate onto hot plate and let it warm.
4. Apply Ball Ground onto plate.
5. Use a roller to even out the coating of Ground.
6. Do not overcook.  Overcooked ground is brittle and tends to chip.
7. When plate is cool you can begin to transfer image and/or draw.

## DRAWING ON THE PLATE:
	
1. Use etching needle or other tools to remove ground.
2. Think in terms of pen and ink rather then graphite or charcoal.
3. You cannot amass large areas of open “black” without ink fall-out.
4. Group lines in optical gray methods to achieve tone, i.e. crosshatching.

## ETCHING THE PLATE:
	
1. Stop out any unwanted areas.
3. The longer the etch the deeper the line.
4. You can stage bite to achieve different qualities of line from the same drawing.
5. The deeper the line (longer the etch), the darker the printed line will be.
6. When you are finished etching rinse off the plate throughly.
7. If desired, add more drawing and etch again. (additive biting).
8. Remember that the “new” drawing will start the clock all over again, while any “old” exposed drawing will continue to get darker.  You can add new drawing as well as stopping out some of the old drawing at this stage.  Allow the stop out to completely dry before putting into the acid bath.  
9. You may wish to keep a log of your etching times throughout working on the plate.

## CLEANING OF THE GROUND:

1. Put the etching onto hot plate to warm ground.
2. Apply vegetable oil and work around the plate with an old rag and/or toothbrush.
3. When ground starts coming up remove from heat and continue to clean.
4. Use a detergent to degrease the plate.

### toxic steps
1. Mineral spirits then alcohol to degrease.
2. If not immediately printing you can skip degreasing the plate. The film left over will help the plate resist oxidation.  To store the plate, wrap it in newsprint.
