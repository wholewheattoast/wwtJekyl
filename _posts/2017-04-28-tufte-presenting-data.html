  <h2>Transcription of my notes from Edward Tufte's Presenting Data and Information
  presentation San Francisco April 26th 2017</h2>
  
  <p>Text in quotes are from Tufte.</p>
  
  <h3>p 98</h3>
  
  <p>Presenting information correctly is a, &quot;Moral and Ethical Act&quot;</p>
  
  <p>
    Going over some examples:
    &quot;Thankfully not overly simple - with cartoony icons.&quot;
  </p>
  
  <p>Begin with a 'Data Paragraph'</p>
  
  <p>Remove the colons (Is talking about 'label: item'). Adds difficulty to reading. Stops flow.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;No more little data items again!&quot;</p>
  
  <h3>p 99</h3>
  <p>Grouping in ... code???</p>
  <ul>
    <li>color</li>
    <li>arrangement</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Involves translation</p>
  
  <p>For little data use numbers.</p>
  
  <p>
    Often codes (talking about special ways of presenting data and/or keys/legends)
    are one off. Wasted Time.
  </p>
  
  <p>Stop it with little data graphics!!!</p>
  
  <h3>p 100</h3>
  <p>Null??? </p>
  
  <p>
    Use Documents not Decks
    Documents are high res, decks low res.
    Decks are time based and rely on short term memory which people are bad at.
    Documents are high res and can be scanned.
  </p>
  
  <p>Use web based docs rather then decks</p>
  
  <p>Consistency is overrated. Viewers don't care.</p>
  
  <h3>p 101</h3>
  <p>Max constant requires? not wasting time figuring out format!</p>
  
  <p>They use their eyes to do something different (on dense layouts)</p>
  
  <p>Bring displays up to the level of our eyes.</p>
  
  <p>On the &quot;Only show seven things&quot; design fad. &quot;Users are not memorizing they are scanning&quot; your material.</p>
  
  <h3>p 102</h3>
  <p>One failure of Responsive Design, large gaps in tables between labels and their data.</p>
  
  <h3>p 103</h3>
  <p>
    I've noticed that all examples have at most 6 colors, similar to our palette,
    with an optional neutral/black for &quot;other&quot;.
  </p>
  
  <p>Bembo font</p>
  
  <p>Devote attention to content not codes.</p>
  
  <p>Put names (labels) on the chart itself. Not always in a legend.</p>
  
  <h3>p 104</h3>
  <p>Get out of 'your' voice and use the voice of the field experts. Gives higher credibility.</p>
  
  <p>Experts can say things you can not due to their authority.</p>
  
  <p>Asses relation between information and conclusions.</p>
  
  <p>Delta's can be brittle.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;Forecasting models are inherently tendentious.&quot;
  &quot;If it can't go on like this, it won't&quot; - saying in Washington d.c.</p>
  
  <h3>p 105</h3>
  <p>&quot;... and everybody dies&quot; </p>
  
  <p>Hard to remember information slide to slide.</p>
  
  <p>mass * velocity squared</p>
  
  <p>Analytical thinking
  Understanding Causality</p>
  
  <h3>p 106</h3>
  <p>
    Analytics/charts are there to answer the question,
    &quot;... Compared to <em>what</em>&quot;.
  </p>
  
  <p>Arrange to help viewers understand content.</p>
  
  <p>re Minard's chart:
  &quot;...He did it because he hated war.&quot;
  &quot;The word 'Napoleon' is not even mentioned. It's about the solders.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Get design out of the way.</p>
  
  <p>Integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams...!!!</p>
  
  <h3>p 107</h3>
  <p>Don't segregate by modes of production.</p>
  
  <p>Don't start with contempt for your audience.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;...then come the strippers.&quot;???</p>
  
  <p>How best can something be explained.</p>
  
  <p>Documentation is the fundamental quality control mechanism.</p>
  
  <p>Put your name on it.</p>
  
  <h3>p 108</h3>
  <p>
    If they don't/won't show the data they are hiding something (cherry picking)
  &quot;It's being audited&quot;
  </p>
  
  <p>&quot;Don't cheat more then 8%.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>
    Re Google flu study
    &quot;Since it's about Google the word 'Hubris' appears many times throughout.&quot;
  </p>
  
  <h3>p 109</h3>
  <p>&quot;No human can look for more then five minutes at a spreadsheet.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Biases in programs/schemas.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;Metabolic Pathways&quot;
  &quot;The unlimited greed...&quot;</p>
  
  <h3>p 110</h3>
  <p>
    Ask simple questions.
    Then answer them.
    &quot;How do you know that&quot;
  </p>
  
  <p>&quot;The prices are completely phony&quot;</p>
  
  <p>&quot;Now when people get an MFA they are learning advertising.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Data paragraphs.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;On a flat surface&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>Don't order data alphabetically, order it substantively.</p>
  
  <h3>p 111</h3>
  <p>Sorting order can reveal a narrative.</p>
  
  <p>If including an item in a table would lead to lots of empty cells, consider a line item instead.</p>
  
  <p>Preparation
  Content and credibility</p>
  
  <p>You can learn a lot by, &quot;Seeing how measurements are made in the field.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Self monitoring often leads to, &quot;Sampling to please&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>Know your content rather then know your audience.</p>
  
  <h3>p 112</h3>
  <p>Don't bother giving reading in advance.</p>
  
  <p>30 min meeting for an A3 double sided page - 15 min reading time. He refers to this time as, &quot;Study Hall&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>If you provide a document you can avoid the nitty gritty - they can read it. you can focus on important items, go meta on presentations... one example is to use time to call out areas where there is not consensus,</p>
  
  <p>Write an Abstract early on to verify you have what you need.</p>
  
  <p>Start early. Prepare. Finish early.</p>
  
  <p>Power point is selfish. Easy for you, hard for your audience.</p>
  
  <p>(Design for compassion)</p>
  
  <p>Jeff Bezos uses study hall format, no power point, 6 page narrative memo.</p>
  
  <h3>p 113</h3>
  <p>&quot;They're reading their indictment&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Do not make an amateur diagnoses. Present observations. Avoid setting bias.</p>
  
  <p>Hand narrative materials reading side facing up to dr.</p>
  
  <p>Dara dump can help with agenda setting.</p>
  
  <h3>p 114</h3>
  <p>Leave room on documents for note taking. One example was to leave a large right hand margin.</p>
  
  <p>Provide reasons to believe.</p>
  
  <p>(Annoy Gardens)</p>
  
  <p>Stop it with un-labeled lines.</p>
  
  <p>Every line should be annotated.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;Sticks and ticks&quot;.</p>
  
  <h3>p 115</h3>
  <p>lunch drawings</p>
  
  <h3>p 116</h3>
  <p>lunch drawings</p>
  
  <h3>p 117</h3>
  <p>lunch drawings</p>
  
  <h3>p 118</h3>
  <p>lunch drawings</p>
  
  <h3>p 119</h3>
  <p>Don't segregate information by the modes of production.</p>
  
  <p>Norm Cox</p>
  
  <p>Turn the corner down.</p>
  
  <p>Discussing move away from documents based systems
  &quot;This leads to siloing information to a specific OS or App.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Ausonio &quot;Tree of Reflections&quot;.</p>
  
  <h3>p 120</h3>
  <p>&quot;2 dimensional sentences&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Feynman Diagrams</p>
  
  <p>&quot;Approximately right rather then exactly wrong&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>Assit in comparisons.</p>
  
  <p>&quot;We have a bias towards seeing Malice and Conspiracies over randomness.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Graphical Significance Testing ?</p>
  
  <p>(here is a place where i'd like to be able to draw a copy of the diagram from notebook)</p>
  
  <h3>p 121</h3>
  
  <p>&quot;To conclude here are some wonderful things.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>&quot;If you want to get out of 'Flatland' go outside and walk around.&quot;</p>
  
  <p>Shows paper cutouts illustrating geometric proofs in an old book on Euclid.</p>
  
  <p>Content adjacent in space.</p>
  
  <h3>p 122</h3>
  
  <p>
                you<br/>
    &quot;How do I know that?&quot;<br/>
                they
